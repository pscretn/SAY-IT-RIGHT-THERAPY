The provision of speech and language therapy services for children with Down syndrome is a controversial issue.
Families receive different services depending on where they live, and the knowledge and interest of local speech and language therapists in the specific needs of children with Down syndrome.
In our view, speech and language development are absolutely central to the cognitive development of all children. 
First, words equal knowledge and the faster a child learns vocabulary, the faster he or she is acquiring knowledge about the world. Secondly, language supports thinking and reasoning.
The human brain has evolved a remarkable ability to learn spoken language with amazing ease and then to use that spoken language for mental activities
